# Github Getter


## Overview

Write a single page JavaScript application that allows users to search through Github repositories via keyword.


## Post-submission ideas

The future is bright with this single page JS application. There are a few notable action steps that can be taken to improve the processing of github data and improving the UI overall.


### Processing of github data

There are many ways to process the github data to enable the user to extract and sort the kind of information they're looking for.

Examples:
1. Adding a sort-by feature:  language, what's trending, etc.
1. Cool idea: Sort-by different coding projects by language (for coding practice purposes)
1. Search: keyword suggestions as you type
1. Github signup/login feature: perform more github-only actions



### Design Improvements

There are plenty of design improvements that can be made to better enhance the user's experience that can be more lively and interactive:

1. Change the list of repository results to a beautiful table of results with a well-designed header, columns, etc.
1. Improve the design of the overlay with a eye-catching gradient
1. More responsive to bigger/smaller screen sizes (especially when the overlay is presented)
1. List items: Need better padding
1. Buttons: The edges can be designed with better curves
1. A beautiful header element could be added (similar to airbnb)


### Just for Fun
Fun ideas to add.

1. Adding a small browser games near the footer (similar to pacman or snake)
1. Adding a xkcd feed near the footer
